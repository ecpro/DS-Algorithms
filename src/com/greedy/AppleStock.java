/**
 * Question: Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

 The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
 The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
 So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

 Write an efficient method that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit
 I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
 *
 * For example:
 int[] stockPricesYesterday = new int[] {10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9};
 getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
 // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
 If we're going to do better than O(n^2), we're probably going to do it in either O(n log(n))or O(n)
 Since we're trying to loop through the array once, let's use a greedy.
